# Task 02 – Neural Style Transfer

## 📄 Project Description

This project demonstrates **Neural Style Transfer** using the pre-trained **VGG19** model from Keras. The goal is to create a new image that preserves the content of one image while adopting the artistic style of another. This is a classic example of a computer vision task using deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## 📦 Technologies and Libraries Used

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* VGG19 (pretrained on ImageNet)
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Pillow

---

## 🖼️ Input Requirements

You need two image files:

* **Content image**: `c.png`
* **Style image**: `cj.jpg`

Both images should be placed in the same directory as the notebook.

---

## 🛠️ Installation

Install all necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib pillow
```

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Image Preprocessing**

   * Both content and style images are resized and normalized using the VGG19-specific preprocessing.
   * The `load_and_process_img()` function handles this task.

2. **Feature Extraction**

   * A modified VGG19 model is used to extract intermediate layers' outputs that capture content and style features.

3. **Gram Matrix**

   * The style is represented using a **Gram matrix** of activations to capture texture and correlations between feature maps.

4. **Loss Calculation**

   * The **total loss** is a weighted sum of content loss and style loss.

5. **Optimization**

   * The image is iteratively updated using **gradient descent** to minimize the total loss.

6. **Output**

   * A stylized image that combines the structure of the content image with the texture/style of the style image.

---

## 📈 Key Parameters

* `content_weight = 1e3`
* `style_weight = 1e-2`
* `num_iterations = 500`

You can tune these parameters in the function `run_style_transfer()`.

## 📸 Output

The result is an image generated by blending `c.png` and `cj.jpg`. It is displayed using `matplotlib`.
